# Communication Tool, Text To Speech
This project is currently a simple application to help non-verbal individuals communicate feelings, emotions and needs to the others using button presses and a typing feature. It has voice choice and a small selection of basic buttons to choose from (will be expanded). Built using Vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML5. I intend to finish this build out for a friend with a currently non-verbal autistic son, so hopefully there will be more added to the grid and a few more options for his kid over time. 

## Project Overview
This project leverages the Web Speech API seen here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API. Also nleverages FontSource for unique different fonts. 
Simple Instructions: Fire up the application and click away. Easy on the eyes interface and a fun tool for those with small children. Can be used on mobile devices due to media queries placed in CSS.

## Features
- Text to speech buttons
- voice change control for personalization
- Type text to speech ability
- some of the hardest wiggle implementation I have achieved to date. No matter how many grid spaces, the text will wiggle away in each one. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, I recommend using the **Live Server** extension in VSCode. Itâ€™s a straightforward and enjoyable way to serve your project.

- **Live Server Extension**: [ritwickdey.LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

### Instructions

1. **Install Live Server**: If you haven't installed the Live Server extension, you can do so from the VSCode marketplace.
2. **Open the Project**: Open the `index.html` file in your VSCode.
3. **Start the Server**:
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file and select **Open with Live Server**.
   - Alternatively, click on the **Go Live** button in the bottom right corner of VSCode.
4. **Access the Application**: Your browser should automatically open with a local server running on port `5500`.

If you prefer using another local server like MAMP, feel free to do so.


## Customization
This is open-source and the code is free to be cloned and used as needed. Some of the CSS is a bit wonky because I am testing different ideas.
